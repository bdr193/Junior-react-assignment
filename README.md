# Battata junior react assignment
Hey! This is a short assignment that tests your skills in React7. Your goal - to build a React app that will look just like the screenshots below, and it has to be fully functioning. You have 48h to complete it from the time you receive this assignment.

This first screenshot allows the user to edit information, that was previously retrieved from a JSON file.

This screenshot shows the state of the app after the user clicks ‘Submit’.

Resources you need:
* The 2 screenshots
* JSON file with the object you will work with

Minimum requirement:
* Create an interface as you see in the screenshot. It should be fully functioning, reacting to human interaction (on hover, on click).
* You have 2 dropdown menus, they should both be created from one component which takes props to build its content.
* After you finishing to build the component - you should populate it with provided data.

Advanced assignment:
* Make all the populated fields editable. User should be able to change the inputs and you should save changes to the state.
* Send saved information by making a POST request to any address you want (e.g. localhost, we don’t care about response). You will need a button for it, which should also be interactive and change its state according to user action.

“Make us proud” level of assignment:
* Use Redux to keep the state of your app.
* Use styled-components (or any other CSS-in-JS) for styles.
* Use TypeScript.

You should show us a working app with no errors and linter warnings. You can use Create React App template, but you can’t use libraries and components made by other people. 

At the end of the assignment, we will take up to 48h to review your code.  After that, we will sit and go through your code together. No need to be stressed, we are not expecting the perfect app and just want to see where you are in your professional journey.
